# Notes

Getting the search results from google and finding the javascript libraries are done by regular expressions.

The javascript libraries are searched in the html source text by searching for text that ends with .js

For testing one can use a unit testing library along with libraries or utilities for simulating network conditions.

Executor are ConcurrentHashMap classes help in writing concurrent code.

Deduplication can be done by getting the contents of each javascript library and using a string similarity metric or a hashing method.
